    <p>I was born and raised in Snellville, Ga and eventually went off to Berry College to attain a Bachelor's Degree in Foreign Studies and Language(Spanish) in order to teach. I quickly learned that teaching Spanish was not my favorite thing in the world. As I pursued a new career I got married in 2016 to my wife, Rachel who graciously accepted my attmpets at finding a new career while she went through a Master's program. I dabbled in a couple different industries but while doing so I discovered the joy of coding, specifically web development. I started the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp in May of 2018 where I currently am a student.</p>
